## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used stackoverflow to search up a couple of errors I was getting because I wasn't really used to the CSS style and HTML.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[One challenge I ran into while completlting the prework was the pictures part, I was able to implement them very easily but I couldn't find a way on how to make the picture pop up only when the user was clicking down on it. I knew there was a way to do it using the onclick feature but I was going in circles trying to figure out how to do onclick = (make the picture appear) so eventually I gave up on that after spending a couple hours until I realized I can go to the styling portion and implement my pictures from there whenever the button was lit, I can make my image pop up.  So I was able to overcome that obstacle]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[A couple questions I do have for web development are definetly what are the nuiansces that come with, because honestly its kind of like creating and making a website look more beautiful and I can just sit around for hours on end making this or that whatever I want it to look like. I know there are nuiansces are everywhere and you have to deal with them but yet with coding sometimes it can be frustrating (almost like you wanna rip your brains out haha)but with CSS/HTML/JavaScript feels very calming and relaxing as you can look at your preview of your website and watch it come to life by each line of code getting written down]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would definetly want to add animations on the buttons, either like make it harder and challenging by having the buttons move around/get re arranged while the clues are given out or just move the buttons after each clue has been given out so you aren't used to the geographical pattern sitting there infront of you. I would also add a random moment in the game that your mouse would have inverted controls, meaning if you go right, then you go left e.t.c and have a 5 timer after each button is correctly clicked, if the player passes that round then they automatically win the game.]
